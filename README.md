# Color Recognition with OpenCV

This is a simple Python project that uses OpenCV to detect colors in an image. When you click on any point in the image, the program shows the name of the color and its RGB values directly on the image and also in the terminal.

---

## âœ¨ Features

-  Click anywhere on the image to detect the color.
-  Shows the color name and its RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values.
- Uses a simple RGB color dataset for name matching.
-  Lightweight and easy to run â€“ just one Python script.

---

## âš™ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- OpenCV (opencv-python)  
- (Optional) A virtual environment like Anaconda

Install dependencies using:

pip install opencv-python

# How to Run
	1.	Clone or download this repository.
	2.	Add your image to the project folder and name it: test_image.jpg
	3.	Run the script:
python color_recognition_image.py

ðŸ“Œ Notes
	â€¢	You can replace the image file with any other image â€“ just update the filename in the code.
	â€¢	The color dataset is basic and may not recognize all shades, but itâ€™s a good starting point.
